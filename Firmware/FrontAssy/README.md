### Building the firmware

Since we do not want to clutter the source directories unneccessarily with build files generated by the compiler all over the place, cmake is used to build the firmware in a separate build directorywhich will be created and switched to next:

```
mkdir build/
cd build/
```

Since cmake does not know about the 8051 architecture build process, we need to give it some information about the toolchain using `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` and refer it to the top level folder, where the CMakeLists.txt file is located. 

```
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=sdcc-toolchain.cmake ../
```

Now the makefiles should have been generated. To build the firmware, simply run `make` and the compiler will build the project. For other available options, please run `make help`.


### Flashing the firmware


No firmware has been flashed yet. If so, try

```
make flash
```
