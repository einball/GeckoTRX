# GeckoTRX Hardware Design Files

GeckoTRX Hardware Repository

## Getting Started

GeckoTRX is a palm-sized Software Defined Radio with a focus on my own education and be a fun project in my spare time. The repository you are looking at is hosting the front assembly of the project, both hardware design files and software source files required to build the project. If you haven't done any programming or software development yet, or just want to download the latest release of the firmware, you may want to have a look at the [Quickstart Guide](#).

## Prerequisites

In order to view the hardware design files, you will need to obtain a copy of [Autodesk's EagleCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/) which is freely available to view the hardware design files. 

The front assembly uses a EFM8BB1 microcontroller which features a 8051 core alongside with the neccessary peripherals to drive the LED's to indicate the transceivers status.
